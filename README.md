# Todo List App

The Todo List App is a software application that helps users to organize personal or professional tasks. With an easy-to-use interface, users can create, edit, and delete tasks, set priorities, due dates, and reminders. This app can increase productivity and track progress by ensuring that all tasks are accounted for and completed on time.

## Testing

The Todo List App includes widget testing, integration testing, and unit testing. Widget testing is used to test the UI components of the app to ensure they are displayed correctly and respond appropriately to user interactions. Integration testing verifies that different parts of the app work together seamlessly, while unit testing tests individual units of code to ensure they perform as expected.

## Firebase Authentication and Cloud Firestore

The Todo List App also uses Firebase Authentication and Cloud Firestore to store todos. Firebase Authentication is used to manage user authentication and authorization, ensuring that only authenticated users can access the app and their own todos. Cloud Firestore is a NoSQL database that is used to store and manage the todos in real-time. This allows users to access and update their todos from different devices and locations, while ensuring data consistency and reliability.

## Technologies Used

- Flutter: A UI toolkit for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.
- Firebase Authentication: A service that provides backend services, easy-to-use SDKs, and ready-made UI libraries to authenticate users to your app.
- Cloud Firestore: A flexible, scalable NoSQL cloud database that lets you store and sync data for client- and server-side development.
